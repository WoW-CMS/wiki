## Steps to follow to be able to contribute.

1. You must have a github account.
2. You have to fork the repository.
3. Once you have a copy of the repository
4. You must clone the repository locally to be able to work on it and make the changes you want to make.
5. When cloning the repository, you have a remote called origin, which points to your repository.

- **origin:** It is the fork, a copy of BlizzCMS inside your user.
- **upstream:** This is the official repository, in this case, the BlizzCMS repository.

**Note:** as you are not part of the development team, but an external contributor to the project, you cannot upload the changes directly to the original BlizzCMS project. You must upload them to your fork, and then create a pull request, where you generally provide the details, so that the project owners can analyze the code, request changes and if everything is correct, merge it.
