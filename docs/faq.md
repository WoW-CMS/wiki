# Frequently Asked Questions

In this section, we will try to answer the most frequently asked questions.

1. Do I need a license to use BlizzCMS-plus?
- No, currently the license has been removed. It is no longer necessary to purchase it.

2. Do I need money to use the CMS?
- Like most open source emulators, BlizzCMS is completely free. It has only 2 rules if you want:
- "Don't remove the credits from the footer, because that helps us to give people who don't know us as a community the opportunity to do so. Even independent developers could arrive, interested in collaborating and improving it".
- If you make modifications in the core, it would be interesting, that you can share them. We are not talking about themes, because they are things of each server and what really makes a site different from another. But if you create a module, or improve part of the emulator code, it would be interesting if you could share it with the rest of the community.
- The CMS is public, and free, and you can use it, but if you make changes, the license says that you should share them.

3. What emulators and game versions do you support?
- BlizzCMS tries to support all the wow expansions known so far, and also most of the emulators. Sometimes, on occasion, emulators make changes to their structures, so the cms must accompany those changes. For example, about 1 year ago, SRP6 was implemented in some emulators, and that made, that for a while, the cms was not compatible with the latest version of TrinityCore. But the CMS was updated, and now supports that type of encryption.

4. Where can I install the CMS?
- The CMS requires a web server, on the <a href="/wiki/requirements" target="_blank">requirements</a> page, we talk about those issues. However, it can be installed on a webhosting, local machine or vps. Generally, for configuration issues, webhosting is recommended, since it comes with built-in mail servers and other tools that in case of using a vps, you will have to configure yourself.

5. How do I set the ranges within the cms?
- Previously, the ranks were managed by the CMS itself, but for quite some time now, it has been managing the same ranks as the emulator. For example, if you have rank 2 in an emulator with AzerothCore, within the CMS, you will be considered a moderator. While if you have rank 3, you will be considered an administrator.

6. Are you working on new modules / functionalities?
- Whenever bugs are reported, the development team tries to provide solutions, and sometimes we even receive code contributions from independent programmers who want to collaborate with the project. Currently the project is under development, since it has many features implemented, however, it still needs to continue improving some of them and add new ones. We even thought about Framework changes, upgrading to Codeigniter 4, Laravel or Symfony, but currently, we continue working with codeigniter version 3.

7. Does the project receive donations?
- Like most open source projects, the community can donate money to the cms. Currently, the official method to do so is through the use of the platform: Ko-fi. <a href="https://ko-fi.com/wowcms" target="_blank">Here is a link to the platform</a>, where you can donate, through coffees, money to the cms, so that it can be allocated among the developers or even pay the servers / servers that it uses to operate.
