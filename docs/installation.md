# Installation

Before attempting installation, review the [requirements](requirements.md).

When downloading / cloning the repository. In the case of Windows, you must place the files inside `htdocs`, and in the case of Linux, normally the path is `/var/www/`, usually in a folder called `html`. Once the files are placed in the corresponding folders, the CMS will open an installation form for the first time.

As you can see in the image, the CMS has some built-in validations. This means that if these validations are not met, the button to install it will not appear no matter how many times you fill in the form fields. Below, we provide information on what to complete in the forms.
