# Configure the store

Before making any configuration in the store, you must read and configure a realm or several realms.

Remember that this documentation is available at the following link <a href="/wiki/create-a-realm" target="_blank">Create a realm</a>

Within the administration menu, we have an option to configure the store. It is located in the following path: `en/admin/store`. **In it, we will find categories, items and a section called top to highlight some of them**.
