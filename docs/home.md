**BlizzCMS plus**, is the improved version of **BlizzCMS v1** (which is an abandoned project). It is currently developed by the WOW-CMS community, and by independent contributors who make improvements to the code on a voluntary basis. It is currently **Open Source**, so everyone can study and improve the code, and it would be interesting that if you make improvements to it, you can share them with the community through a pull request.
